## Hi, I'm Sue 👋

I work at the intersection of technology, data, and people.

I'm a Technical Writer in healthcare technology with a background in
information systems, analytics, and compliance — focused on making
complex systems understandable and usable.

### What I'm Working On
- Learning Python for data analysis and light automation
- Building practical analytics and cloud projects (not algorithm marathons)
- Studying cybersecurity fundamentals with an eye toward GRC

### How I Think About Tech
- Systems > snippets
- Clarity beats cleverness
- Documentation is part of the product

### Tools & Topics
- Python • SQL • Git/GitHub  
- AWS (Cloud Practitioner level)  
- Power BI • QuickSight • Excel  
- Security+, HIPAA, NIST (learning & applying)

### A Fun Fact
In the late 1990s, a professor once said, *"One day there will be data mining."*  
He was right.
